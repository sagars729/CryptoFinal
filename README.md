Cryptography Period 3

Created By Sagar Saxena and Vibhu Kundeti

This repository contains the Python3 implementations for two algorithms that use public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
 
##Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
With DSA, messages are signed by the signer's private key and the signatures are verified by the signer's corresponding public key. The private key consists of a single integer x, while the public key consists of four integers (p,q,g,y) which is accompanied with the signature (r,s). It is crucial that the entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness of the random signature value k are critical. If any of the three are violated, it is possible that the entire private key could be revealed.
